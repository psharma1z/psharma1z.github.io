####Dataset

The dataset used for the project is obtained from the kaggle and it is a public dataset. I have copied the dataset in the data directory and i plan to use it from there in the code.

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics
Sources: WHO Mortality Database online tool
Data prepared using this WHO tool: http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality/whodpms/

####Review Criteria Essay

Below are the review criteris explained:

- Messaging. What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

The visualization explains 

- Narrative Structure. Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)

- Visual Structure. What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?

- Scenes. What are the scenes of your narrative visualization?  How are the scenes ordered, and why

- Annotations. What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why

- Parameters. What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

- Triggers. What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?
